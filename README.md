# Sharkwork-


This is a data analysis and cleaning project made as part of a Bootcamp, in April 2023.
Please be aware that it is the first attempt at something of this size, and that this is my second week here, so **PLEASE** take that into consideration when checking out the files included.

The data was obtained from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teajay/global-shark-attacks.

Cleanup of the data was the **main objective** of this data analysis, with "objective and conclusions" per se being second. 

This document will be updated once the cleanup has been more or less done, and proper analysis can be done towards a certain goal.
